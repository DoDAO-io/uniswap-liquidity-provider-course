    In Uniswap v3, the profit and loss (PnL) for a liquidity provider (LP) are
    primarily determined by two factors: fees earned and changes in asset values
    due to price movements. These can also be affected by other factors like gas
    costs for transactions and impermanent loss, among others.


    1. **Fees Earned**: As an LP, you earn fees on trades that occur within the
    price range you've set for your liquidity. In Uniswap v3, the fees are not
    distributed evenly among all LPs but rather are proportional to the amount
    of liquidity you provide within the active price range. The more your
    liquidity is utilized (i.e., the more trades that happen within your set
    price range), the more fees you earn.


    2. **Changes in Asset Values**: The other component of PnL calculation in
    Uniswap v3 is the changes in the value of the assets you've provided as
    liquidity. This is where the concept of impermanent loss comes into play.

        **Impermanent loss** happens when the price of your assets changes compared to when you deposited them. If the relative price of your two assets changes, you could end up with less value than if you had simply held onto the assets. This loss is "impermanent" because it could be negated if the prices revert back to their original state.

    3. **Gas Costs**: This is especially important in Uniswap v3 because of its
    capital efficiency feature. Liquidity providers might adjust their positions
    more frequently, which incurs Ethereum network transaction (gas) fees.


    However, calculating PnL in Uniswap v3 is complex due to these factors and
    others, like the specific price range you choose as a liquidity provider.
    The specific price range and liquidity depth can significantly affect the
    profitability of providing liquidity. Also, other factors such as managing
    liquidity actively or passively, anticipating the market movements, etc.,
    can affect the PnL.

    ### **Uniswap v3 Position Definitions**


    - **Pooled_assets**: The total value of the position in USD.

    - **APR**: The yearly return rate considering the value of the position
    assets, deposits, withdrawals, gas costs, and staking rewards at current
    prices.

    - **Fee APR**: The yearly return rate based on accrued fees only, without
    considering divergence loss.

    - **APR_excluding_gas**: The yearly return rate taking into account the
    value of the position, fees, and divergence loss, but ignoring gas costs.

    - **Pool_PnL & Total_PnL**: These metrics measure the profit and loss for a
    position. While Pool PnL considers only fees and price divergence, Total PnL
    also factors in gas costs and reward incentives.

    - **Current_assets**: The current amount of tokens associated with this
    liquidity provider (LP) position.

    - **Invested_assets & Withdrawn**: The total assets put into and taken out
    of the position, respectively.

    - **Reserves**: The USD value of the token reserves for the pool.

    - **Volume**: The USD value of the traded volume within the pool.

    - **Price_divergence**: The absolute difference between the percentage
    changes in prices for the underlying assets compared to the prices 30 days
    ago. This can lead to losses for LPs if the two assets' prices diverge
    significantly.

    - **Position_age**: The time (in days) since the position was first created.
