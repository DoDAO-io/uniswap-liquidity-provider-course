  content: What is impermanent loss in the context of Uniswap v3?
  hint: 'NoHint'
  explanation: >-
    Impermanent loss happens when the price of your assets changes compared to when you deposited them. If the relative price of your two assets changes, you could end up with less value than if you had simply held onto the assets. This loss is "impermanent" because it could be negated if the prices revert back to their original state.
