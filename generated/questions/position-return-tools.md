##### What is impermanent loss in the context of Uniswap v3?  

- [x]  Decrease in value due to price changes of deposited assets
- [ ]  Increase in value due to price changes of deposited assets
- [ ]  Loss incurred due to Ethereum network transaction fees
- [ ]  Loss incurred due to trades outside of set price range
  
Hint: NoHint
         
Explanation: Impermanent loss happens when the price of your assets changes compared to when you deposited them. If the relative price of your two assets changes, you could end up with less value than if you had simply held onto the assets. This loss is "impermanent" because it could be negated if the prices revert back to their original state.

##### Why might liquidity providers adjust their positions more frequently in Uniswap v3?  

- [ ]  To decrease impermanent loss
- [ ]  To earn more fees
- [x]  To take advantage of the capital efficiency feature
- [ ]  To anticipate market movements
  
Hint: NoHint
         
Explanation: This is especially important in Uniswap v3 because of its capital efficiency feature. Liquidity providers might adjust their positions more frequently, which incurs Ethereum network transaction (gas) fees.

##### What is the meaning of "Price_divergence" in Uniswap v3 Pool Definitions provided by Revert?  

- [x]  The absolute difference between the percentage changes in prices for the underlying assets compared to the prices 30 days ago.

Hint: NoHint
